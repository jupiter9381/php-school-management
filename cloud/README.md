## Is it secure?
Short answer. YES! phpFileManager is secure, but you must set a password on it.
The script can be renamed and deployed on an unique known url, that helps you keep it hidden.
But you have to set a password! Obviously!
If you do not, this script will allow any person to access it, that is the default setting.
And that is why i provide this script, with the following disclaimer.
